# Type Regatta

## Description
Type Regatta is an app where users can test their typing skills against the clock.

## Motive
What made me decide to make Type Regatta was I was playing a lot of Type Racer, and I thought it was a compelling challenge to make my own typing game.

## What I Learned 
I learned how to use Bootstrap, learned how to customize Bootstrap with SASS, and learned how to use a CSS framework with React.
